# Crypto Concepts: briefly explained (TLDR)

## Blockchain
A decentralized and immutable ledger technology where transactions are recorded in blocks and linked together cryptographically, ensuring security and transparency across a network of computers.

## Smart contract
A smart contract is a self-executing program that automates the actions required in an agreement or contract, without the need for intermediaries. Once completed, the transactions are trackable and irreversible.

## Bridge
A mechanism that facilitates the interoperability between different blockchain networks, enabling assets to be transferred securely and seamlessly across multiple platforms.

## GAS token
A token used to pay for transaction fees on a blockchain network, typically associated with executing smart contracts or transferring digital assets.

## ERC-20 token
A technical standard for fungible tokens on the Ethereum blockchain, defining a set of rules and functions such as how the tokens can be transferred, how transactions are approved, and the total supply of tokens.

## Wallet
Software or hardware that securely stores private keys used to access and manage cryptocurrencies. It allows users to send, receive, and store digital assets. More often offers the functionality of encrypting and/or signing information (Smart Contract).

## ChainPort bridge
The Ultimate Next-Generation Cross-Chain Bridge Powered by PORTX Token, the only bridge that supports all common bridging methods and core architectures with an emphasis on security & ease of use.

#### Full disclosure

This task took about 2 minutes with the use of ChatGPT + 5 more minutes to verify correctness using google search + 5 more minutes to gather the right data about the ChainPort bridge.
ChatGPT did a fine job on shortly explaining the ChainPort bridge, but lacked key technical details.

# Super simple TLDR Crypto Concepts:

* **Blockchain**: It's like a special book where we write down everything we buy or sell, but instead of one person having the book, everyone has a copy. This way, nobody can change what's written, and we can all make sure it's fair.
* **Smart contract**: Picture a magical vending machine. You put in your request and the exact coins it asks for, and the machine automatically gives you the item. Like making sure people get what they agreed to without needing someone else to help.
* **Bridge**: Think of a bridge like a magical tunnel that helps two different lands talk to each other. This way, people and things can travel between them easily and safely.
* **GAS token**: It's like a special coin you need to make sure your machine (smart contract) can do its job.
* **ERC-20 token**: These are special coins that follow certain rules so they can work on a special computer island called Ethereum.
* **Wallet**: It's like a secret treasure box for your digital coins and keys. You use it to keep your coins safe and to send them to your friends when you want to share.
* **ChainPort bridge**: Imagine the biggest, coolest bridge ever that helps all the different islands (blockchains) talk to each other. It's super safe and easy to use.
